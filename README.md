# AmoebaJS

AmoebaJS is a linear constraint solver for the web. It's based on a WebAssembly
compilation of Xavier Wang's [Amoeba][] C library, bound with an idiomatic
JavaScript interface.

AmoebaJS is provided in its original source as ES6 + LLVM bytecode, a web
distribution which attaches the module to `window.amoeba`, and a NodeJS
distribution which can be `require()`d. Additional targets may be built for by
users; consult the [webpack config][] for some starting points.

## Installation

You can use NPM or Yarn to install:

    $ npm install amoebajs


## Usage

Import and create a solver:

    let amoeba = require('amoebajs/node')

    let solver = new amoeba.Solver()

Set up variables:

    let v1 = solver.newVariable(), v2 = solver.newVariable()

Set up constraints, and call `.add()` to enable them:

    v1.mustEqual(v2.divide(2).subtract(4)).add()

Suggest a value for one variable:

    v1.suggest(10)

Read variable values:

    console.log("v1 = " + v1.value) // v1 = 10
    console.log("v2 = " + v2.value) // v2 = 28
